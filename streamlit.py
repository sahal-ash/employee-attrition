        """
        Welcome to the **Employee Attrition Prediction System**. 
        This tool is designed to help HR teams and management predict whether employees are likely to leave the organization, 
        based on various personal and professional factors. The prediction uses a trained machine learning model.

        **How it works:**
        - Input relevant details about an employee.
        - Click on the `Predict` button to view the result.
        - Use the insights to make informed decisions regarding employee retention.

        **Note:** All data is hypothetical and for demonstration purposes only.
